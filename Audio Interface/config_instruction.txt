*config.json syntax*
/*
  "appliance_name": "name of appliance",
  "functions": self explanatory
  "operations_1": list the operations of the first function 
  "operatoins_2": list the operations of the second function
  Operations typically should have an ending such that "ing" can be added on and it will 
  be grammatically correct. 
  FUNCTIONS AND OPERATIONS MUST BE IN LIST FORMAT even if there is only one operation or one function.
